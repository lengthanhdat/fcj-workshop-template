# Initializing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the heart of our AWS infrastructure network.

**Note (Cost-Optimization):** Although the Enterprise design diagram requires splitting Public/Private Subnets and using a NAT Gateway, to maximize the practice budget savings (about $86/month), we will deploy the **Optimized Architecture (Using only Public Subnets)**. Security will be strictly tightened through Security Groups.

---

### Step 1: Create VPC with "VPC and more"

1. Access the **VPC** service on the AWS Console interface.
2. Click the orange **Create VPC** button in the upper right corner.
3. Select the **VPC and more** option (this option helps auto-create related components).
4. Configure the parameters as follows:
   - **Name tag auto-generation:** `aura-academic`
   - **IPv4 CIDR block:** `10.0.0.0/16`
   - **Number of Availability Zones (AZs):** Select `2` (Mandatory to have 2 AZs to install a Load Balancer).
   - **Number of public subnets:** Select `2`
   - **Number of private subnets:** Select `0` (Cost optimization for Students)
   - **NAT gateways:** Select **None** (Very Important ⚠️ - Helps save $86/month).
   - **VPC endpoints:** Select **None**.
5. Click the **Create VPC** button and wait for AWS to automatically create the Subnets, Internet Gateway, and Route Tables.

### Step 2: Enable "Auto-assign public IP" for Public Subnets

For virtual machines (EC2) or Containers (ECS) located in the Public Subnet to automatically receive a Public IP address and access the Internet, we need to enable this feature:

1. On the left menu of the VPC service, select **Subnets**.
2. Find and check the first subnet containing the word `public` in its name: **`aura-academic-subnet-public1-ap-southeast-1a`**.
3. Click the **Actions** button (at top right) -> Select **Edit subnet settings**.
4. Check the box **Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address** -> **Save**.
5. Repeat exact steps 2-4 for the second public subnet: **`aura-academic-subnet-public2-ap-southeast-1b`**.
*(Note: Never enable this feature for the 2 subnets with `private` in their names).*

### Step 3: Set up Security Groups (Firewall)

Since all resources are located in the Public Subnet, the Security Group (SG) acts as a "vital checkpoint" to protect the system from Hackers:

1. On the left menu, scroll down to the Security section, select **Security groups** -> **Create security group**.
2. **ALB Security Group (For Load Balancer):**
   - Name: `aura-academic-alb-sg`
   - VPC: Select the newly created `aura-academic` VPC.
   - Inbound rules: Allow `HTTP` (Port 80) and `HTTPS` (Port 443) from `Anywhere-IPv4`.

3. **ECS Backend Security Group:**
   - Name: `aura-academic-ecs-sg`
   - VPC: Select `aura-academic` VPC.
   - Inbound rules: 
     - Custom TCP, Port `8080`, Source: Click the magnifying glass icon and type `alb`, then select **`aura-academic-alb-sg`** (Only allow traffic from ALB into Backend, strictly block direct internet access).

4. **EC2 GPU Security Group (For AI):**
   - Name: `aura-academic-ai-sg`
   - VPC: Select `aura-academic` VPC.
   - Inbound rules: 
     - Custom TCP, Port `8001`, Source: Click the magnifying glass icon and type `alb`, then select **`aura-academic-alb-sg`** (For WebSockets from ALB).
     - Custom TCP, Port `4000`, Source: Click the magnifying glass icon and type `ecs`, then select **`aura-academic-ecs-sg`** (For internal API from Backend).
     - (There is NO NEED to open Port 22 for SSH, because we will use AWS Systems Manager (Session Manager) to securely connect to the Private Subnet).

At this point, the super cost-effective and secure network backbone of the system is ready! We can move on to the [Next Stage](../6.3-ecs-backend) to configure the Backend.
